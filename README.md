4. If you were to invest in a restaurant, which characteristics would you be looking for?

### Data Sourcing

Digitately Drive (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c1HKM8UTqwWOgexRLOtEJuxjBiA2N6xf/view?usp=drive_link) There are 5 tables and all were used in this analysis

### Data Modelling

Automatically derived relationships which can be adjusted to remove and replace unwanted relationships with the required.

### Visualisation
